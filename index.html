 <p> My favourite hobby is singing and listening to music. Even my voice is not good but I still like to sing. While I listen to music, I feel relax and calm. Singing is an excellent way of entertainment.
I like to sing because it is fun to sing. I also like to sing because I like to sing with my friends. Singing gives me a great pleasure.
 It helps me to forget my daily problems. Every person has his own favourite groups or singers. My favourite singers are Neha Kakkar.
 I like to sing very much. I like music. I want to become a good singer. I am working very hard to achieve my goal. I hope one day I will become a great singer.
